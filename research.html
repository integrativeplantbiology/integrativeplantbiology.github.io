    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> MYB transcription factors (TFs) represent one of the biggest TF families in plants, being involved in various specific plant processes, such as responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. The implication of MYB TFs in the tolerance mechanisms to abiotic stress is particularly interesting for crop breeding, since environmental conditions can negatively affect growth and productivity. Wheat is a worldwide-cultivated cereal, and is a major source of plant-based proteins in human food. In particular, durum wheat plays an important role in global food security improvement, since its adaptation to hot and dry conditions constitutes the base for the success of wheat breeding programs in future.</p>
